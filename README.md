# Anime Character Generation Using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN)

This project aims to generate high-quality anime character images using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN). By training the model on a dataset of anime images, the DCGAN learns to create new, visually appealing anime characters.

## Introduction

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. DCGAN is a type of GAN that uses deep convolutional networks in both the generator and discriminator. This project implements a DCGAN to generate anime character images.

## Dataset

The dataset should consist of anime character images. You can collect these images from various sources or use an existing dataset like the Anime Faces dataset. Make sure the images are preprocessed and resized to a suitable dimension (e.g., 64x64 pixels).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

### Training the Model

To train the DCGAN model, run the `train.py` script. You can specify the training parameters such as number of epochs, batch size, etc.

```bash
python train.py --epochs 10000 --batch_size 64
```

### Generating Images

After training the model, you can generate new anime character images using the `generate.py` script.


Generated images will be saved in the `generated_images/` directory.

## Results

Once the model is trained, it will generate new anime character images that look similar to the ones in the training dataset. Here are some examples of the generated images:
